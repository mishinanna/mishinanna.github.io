<h2>How to make rack of lamb</h2>

<p><strong>2. Mix:</strong> In a small food processor, combine the olive oil, parsley, garlic, rosemary, and thyme leaves and pulse until everything is thoroughly mixed.</p>

<p><strong>3. Rub:</strong> Using a sharp knife, score the fat layer on the lamb by making several cuts through the fat. Rub the garlic-herb mixture all over the rack of lamb.</p>

<p><strong>4. Marinate:</strong> Place the rack of lamb in a large Ziploc bag. Seal the bag and leave it at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours, max. You can also marinate it overnight in the refrigerator, just bring to room temperature before cooking.</p>

<p><strong>5. Roast:</strong> Preheat oven to 450˚F. Take the lamb out of the bag and place it on a baking pan fat side up. Cover the exposed ribs with foil so they don’t burn while they’re roasting.</p>
<ul> 
     <li> Roast the rack of lamb for 25 minutes or until the internal temperature registers at 125˚F for rare or 135˚F for medium-rare. Use an Instant Read Thermometer for the most accurate results.</li>
</ul>

	<p><strong>6. Rest and Serve:</strong> Remove the lamb from the oven. Loosely cover it with foil and let it rest for 15 minutes before cutting.</p>
<p><strong>SERVING SUGGESTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Lamb meat is super rich to begin with, so, when serving a rack of lamb, I like to keep my sides light. I really like a side of <a href="https://diethood.com/mushroom-orzo-pilaf/">mushroom orzo pilaf</a> or quinoa with this dish. And, green veggies also pair excellently with roasted rack of lamb. Think, sauteed green beans, <a href="https://diethood.com/grilled-asparagus-recipe/">roasted grilled asparagus</a>, or broccolini.</p>
